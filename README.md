> A string over the characters '{,},(,),[,]' is said to be well-formed if the different types of brackets 
> match in the correct order.
>For example, '([]){()}' is well-formed, as is '[()[]{()()}]]'. However, '{)', '()', and '[()[]{()()' are
>not well-formed,
>Write a program that tests if a string made up of the characters '(', ')' ,'[' ,']','{' and '}' is well-formed.
>Hint: Which left parenthesis does a right parenthesis match with?
